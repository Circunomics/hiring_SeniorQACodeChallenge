# hiring_SeniorQaCodeChallenge
Code Challenge for hiring a Senior QA specialist

## Challenge Description
You are required to create an automated test suite for this [demo site](https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/). This challenge will test your ability to handle complex scenarios, integrate with external systems, and ensure robust test automation. You can use any test tool of your choice, such as Selenium, Cypress or similar tools.

## Scenarios to Cover
**API Integration**: Verify that the web application correctly interacts with an external API.
**Parallel Test Execution**: Configure your test suite to run tests in parallel to reduce execution time.
**Advanced Assertions**: Implement custom assertions to validate complex conditions.
**Reporting**: Generate detailed test reports with screenshots for failed tests.

## Setup
1. Fork this repository
2. Create a *source* folder to contain your code. 

## Once Complete
1. Create a SETUP.md in the base directory with setup instructions.
2. Create a private repository on GitHub and grant access to jobs@circunomics.com.
3. Please let us know that you have completed the challenge (send email to jobs@circunomics.com).

## Instructions
**Create Tests**: Implement the remaining test scenarios (API Integration, Parallel Test Execution, Advanced Assertions, and Reporting) in a similar manner.
**Documentation**: Document your test cases, any assumptions you make, and the setup process.

## Evaluation Criteria
**Completeness**: How well you cover the most valuable scenarios need to cover all scenarios. You can describe in the SETUP.md file, what you could do more if you have more time.

**Code Quality**: Readability, maintainability, and use of best practices.

**Documentation**: Clarity and thoroughness of your documentation.

**Problem-Solving**: How you handle any challenges or edge cases.

**Efficiency**: Use of parallel execution and reporting to optimize the test suite.
